// Step 1: Create a string for the user saying: You have received this message because you have been chosen to open an important vault. Here is the secret combination:
const prompt = "You have received this message because you have been chosen to open an important vault. Here is the secret combination:";

// Step 2: Display prompt using alert popup
alert(prompt);

//Step 4: using mathematical operator - to calculate for 10; 
//assigning result to a variable
const num1 = 15 - 5;

//Step 5: using mathematical operator * to calculate for 40;
//assigning result to a variable
const num2 = 20 * 2;

//Step 6: using mathematical operator + to calculate for 39;
//assigning result to a variable 
const num3 = 25 + 14;

//Step 7:Creating a popup dialog to display vault codes
//using backticks and assigned variables
alert(`Vault Codes: ${num1}-${num2}-${num3}`);
